# RESTAPI
Your REST API project is designed to perform various CRUD operations, file parsing, and data sanitization functions, implemented using **Golang** and the **Gin web framework**. Here’s a breakdown of the technical aspects and key functions:

### 1. **Core CRUD Operations**
   - **HTTP Methods**: The API supports standard RESTful operations using HTTP methods:
      - **GET**: Retrieves specific or multiple records.
      - **POST**: Creates a new resource, with JSON data provided in the request body.
      - **PUT**: Updates existing records based on provided data.
      - **DELETE**: Removes records from the database.
   - **Data Flow**: Each HTTP request is routed through Gin, processed by respective handler functions, and interacts with the database to manage resources.

### 2. **File Parsing and Conversion**
   - The API can convert files between different formats, with parsing capabilities for **CSV** and **Excel** files.
   - **CSV/Excel to JSON**: When a file is uploaded, the API reads data rows, assigns keys from the header row, and converts the data into JSON format.
   - **Data Sanitization**: This includes handling empty headers, merging cells, duplicate headers, and providing default headers where necessary.

### 3. **Data Cleaning and Header Management**
   - **User-Configurable Options**:
      - **Header Labels**: Allows users to edit or provide custom headers if the first row of the file doesn’t contain meaningful labels.
      - **Trim Option**: The API includes a trim option to remove leading and trailing spaces from data, ensuring clean and consistent data entries.
   - **Duplicate and Empty Header Handling**: The API checks for and resolves duplicate headers by appending unique identifiers and ensures columns with data but no headers are assigned default labels.

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Validation**: Ensures input data is valid before processing (e.g., checking if required fields are present).
   - **Logging**: Uses structured logging for easy debugging and tracking of API requests, errors, and response times.

### 5. **Testing and API Documentation**
   - **Postman Integration**: The API is thoroughly tested via Postman for each CRUD endpoint, as well as data parsing and cleaning functionalities. Postman is used to automate testing with custom headers, data trimming options, and various file parsing scenarios, validating the API’s reliability and flexibility across use cases.

This REST API project is versatile and ensures accurate data exchange, with a robust backend built for high-performance and clean data management.
